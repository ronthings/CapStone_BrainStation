# CapStone_BrainStation
The project was prepared as a final fulfillment of BrainStaion Data Science Course.

Primary objective was to predict customers at the risk of churn using an ecommerce industry data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) and different model algorithms.

## Repository Contents and Path

The notebooks in this repository follows a sequential path:

- **Notebook #1 - Data Cleaning and Wrangling**
In this notebook, I loaded the raw dataset from the source, conducted data cleaning where applicable, and dived into exploratory data analysis to obtain insights from the data prior to preprocessing and modelling.

- **Notebook #2 - Feature Engineering**
In this notebook, I loaded the cleaned up and feature engineered dataset from Notebook #1, and transformed it to be model ready. This includes transforming categorical columns to numeric columns.

- **Notebook #3 - Data Exploration**
In this notebook, I loaded the preprocessed, model ready dataset and fitted it on the models mentioned above. I then optimized the best performing base models to get even better model performance.

- **Notebook #4 - Modeling**

- **Notebook #5 - Unsupervised Learning**

- **Tableau File** - contains visuals created for the project.
